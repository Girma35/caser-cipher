# Caesar Cipher

## Project Description

The **Caesar Cipher** is a simple yet classic encryption technique used to encode messages by shifting letters in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. This project implements the Caesar Cipher in Python, allowing users to easily encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Features

- **Encode and Decode**: Easily encode and decode messages using the Caesar Cipher.
- **Customizable Shift**: Choose a custom shift value for the cipher to suit your needs.
- **Case Handling**: Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **Non-Alphabetic Characters**: Preserves non-alphabetic characters such as spaces and punctuation, maintaining the original structure of the message.
